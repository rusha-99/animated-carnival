SCS 2204 - Functional Programming
Scala Tutorial â€“ 5
1. Write a recursive function prime(n) that returns true for a prime number
   and false for the other? For example prime(5) should return true and
   prime(8) should return false.
2. Write a recursive function primeSeq(n) that prints all prime number
   which less than n? For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the
   terminal.
3. Write a recursive function returns the addition of numbers from1 to n?
   For example sum(5) should print 15
4. Write a recursive function to determine even and odd numbers?
5. Write a recursive function to get the addition of all even numbers less
   than given n.
6. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
   21, 34, . . .
   Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Write a
   recursive function print fist n Fibonacci numbers for given n.
